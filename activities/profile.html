    <h1>Hello, My name is Wang</h1>
    <p>
        I am a student from China. I have lived in China for a long time, 
        almost my whole life. But I also spent a few years studying abroad to improve myself. 
        I served the church for a period of time in the United States and learned a lot
        during this time. At the same time, I learned English. Because during this time, 
        I had to force myself to learn English, so I am very grateful for this experience.
        Now I came to Hawaii to study computing and science. One of the courses is CS140,
        which allows me to learn how to edit web pages. That's why I will make this website.
    </p>
    
    <p>When I was studying here, I found that I actually like the beach very much. 
        Because when I feel a lot of pressure in my studies, I find that walking 
        on the beach can relieve this pressure. In this case, I can enjoy the beautiful 
        scenery of Hawaii. The environment here is very good and the air is very fresh. 
        Especially when I look at the sea, I can see a lot of life swimming in the sea. 
        And when I came here, I also learned to surf. Surfing is a very exciting activity. 
        Of course, when studying, it is very difficult, so I didn't make any special progress 
        after studying for a while. I hope it will get better and better in the future.
    </p>
