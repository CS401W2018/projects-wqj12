                    <h3>Mulan</h3>
                    <p>Hua Mulan has been very filial since childhood. He has an older sister 
                        and a younger brother, and has a harmonious relationship with his 
                        brothers and sisters. However, his family environment made him 
                        strong-willed. He did not think that women were weaker than men, and 
                        would help the family with important things. So in the end, he joined 
                        the war in place of his father without regrets.</p>

                    <h3>Father</h3>
                    <p>His father had served his country when he was young and made many 
                        contributions to his country, but the war also caused him to suffer 
                        various injuries, which led to his poor health in old age. When the 
                        country needed him again, he was no longer able to fight again.</p>

                    <h3>Mother</h3>
                    <p>Hua Mulan's mother was also a noble lady from a prominent family with 
                        a good family environment, so her mother's character became very 
                        virtuous. She worked hard to raise three children at home and had a 
                        very good relationship with her husband. She was willing to support 
                        any decision her husband made. It was precisely because of this 
                        character that when Hua Mulan argued for her father, her mother was 
                        also very worried.</p>
