                In our daily lives, we frequently require a computer to help our work
                 and studies. We sometimes need to take the computer out of the office
                 and work outside. At this point, we require a laptop so that we do not
                 have to lug heavy items outside and seek for outlets everywhere.

                In addition to portability, laptops offer a wide range of features that
                 make them convenient for both personal and professional use. Most modern
                 laptops are equipped with powerful processors, ample storage, and
                 long-lasting batteries, making them suitable for tasks ranging from
                 writing documents and managing spreadsheets to more resource-intensive
                 work like video editing or coding. The ability to work anywhere—whether
                 at a coffee shop, library, or park—without compromising on performance
                 is a key advantage that desktops cannot offer.(paraphrase by chat)
